# Checkers Game in Python
## Project Description
This project is an implementation of the traditional ***Checkers game***, created as part of a first-year university coursework assignment. The game is written in *Python* and features a graphical user interface **(GUI)** for an interactive and user-friendly experience.
## Features
* **Graphical User Interface:** The game has a visually appealing ***GUI*** designed with the Pygame library, which provides an intuitive and entertaining user experience.
* **Two-Player Mode:** The game allows two players to compete against each other using the same device.
* **Move Validation:** Enforces requirements for valid moves, such as capturing opponent pieces and following the necessary jumping rule.
* **Queen Pieces:** Allows pieces to be promoted to queens when they reach the opposite side of the board, resulting in increased movement capabilities.
* **Game status Management:** Tracks the status of the game, including player turns, captured pieces, and endgame conditions.
* **AI Opponent:** Uses the ***Minimax*** algorithm with ***alpha-beta pruning*** optimization to make efficient decisions.
